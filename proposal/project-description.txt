Brief description of the project

For use in medium-energy research, a polarized, internal atom beam target for the COSY storage and cooling synchrotron (JÃ¼lich) 
is to be developed and constructed using laser light. In addition to the theoretical investigations to be carried out, this 
research project aims to enable the experimental setup and further optimization of the atomic beam technology and laser 
manipulation of atomic beams. The use of resonant light pressure forces allows the increase in beam densities required for 
internal atomic beam targets and a high degree of polarization of the atomic beam. The combination of transverse 
atomic beam cooling and laser manipulation of atomic beams is a promising approach for the development of internal 
atomic beam targets. Light pressure forces allows the beam densities required for internal atomic beam targets to be 
increased and a high degree of polarization of the atomic beam to be achieved. By combining transverse atomic beam 
cooling and the application of light fields with inhomogeneous field gradients (dipole force), the atomic beam is 
to be further compressed in phase and space.
