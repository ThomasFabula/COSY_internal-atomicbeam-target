abstract = {COSY JÃ¼lich is a cooler synchrotron and storage ring with a proton momentum range from 270 to 3300 MeV/c. It has been conceived to deliver high precision beams for medium energy physics. To accomplish this goal two cooling systems are foreseen: an electron cooling system for the momentum range up to 645 MeV/c and a stochastic cooling system which covers the upper momentum range from 1500 to 3300 MeV/c. Proton beams in a wide momentum range have been delivered to internal as well as external experiments. The beam properties measured by these experiments and the main parameters of COSY are presented.}
