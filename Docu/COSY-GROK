The Cooler Synchrotron (COSY) was a particle accelerator and storage ring at the Forschungszentrum Jülich in Germany, 
operated by the Institute for Nuclear Physics (IKP) from 1993 until October 2023. With a circumference of 184 meters, 
it accelerated protons and deuterons to momenta between 270 MeV/c and 3.65 GeV/c for experiments in hadron, particle, 
and nuclear physics. COSY was known for its beam cooling techniques—electron cooling up to 645 MeV/c and stochastic 
cooling from 1.5 to 3.3 GeV/c—which ensured high-precision, well-ordered beams for medium-energy physics research.

Overview

The Cooler Synchrotron COSY, located at Forschungszentrum Jülich in Germany, was a significant particle accelerator 
used for scientific research. It ran from 1993 until its closure in October 2023, contributing to fields like 
hadron physics and nuclear studies. Known for its innovative beam cooling methods, COSY enabled precise experiments 
that advanced our understanding of subatomic structures. Today, it is no longer in operation, leaving a legacy 
in scientific advancements.

Technical Details

COSY accelerated protons and deuterons, offering beams with energies from 45 to 2700 MeV for protons and 90 to 2100 
MeV for deuterons. It employed electron cooling up to 645 MeV/c and stochastic cooling for higher momenta, ensuring 
high-quality beams for experiments. The facility supported both internal experiments, with targets and detectors 
within the ring, and external ones, where beams were extracted for use outside.

Key Points
- The Cooler Synchrotron COSY at Forschungszentrum Jülich in Germany operated from 1993 to October 2023, focusing on 
hadron, particle, and nuclear physics.
- It used advanced beam cooling techniques for high-precision experiments and supported both internal and external setups.
- As of July 2025, COSY is no longer operational, having ceased activities in October 2023.

Key Features
- Particle Beams: Delivered polarized and unpolarized proton beams (45–2700 MeV) and deuteron beams (90–2100 MeV).
- Cooling Systems: Used electron cooling for low momenta and stochastic cooling for higher momenta to reduce beam 
divergence and enhance precision.
- Experiments: Supported internal (e.g., ANKE, TOF, WASA) and external experimental setups, focusing on hadron physics, 
meson production, and medium modifications in proton-nucleus interactions.
- Research Focus: Recent work included investigating the electric dipole moment (EDM) of protons and deuterons 
(JEDI collaboration), testing components for the Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR), and exploring 
axion-like dark matter.
- Injection: H⁻ or D⁻ ions were produced, accelerated by the JULIC cyclotron to 45 MeV, stripped to protons or
deuterons via a carbon foil, and injected into COSY.

Scientific Contributions

COSY enabled high-precision experiments probing the strong interaction, quark-gluon structures, and CP violation 
through EDM measurements. It served as a unique "hadron microscope" for studying subatomic structures, offering 
beam energies ideal for resolving proton and neutron components. The accelerator supported both internal experiments
(target and detector within the ring) and external ones (beam extracted via resonant or stochastic methods).

Closure and Legacy

Research indicates that COSY ceased operations in October 2023, a decision likely influenced by the shift towards 
newer facilities like FAIR and resource allocation priorities. As of July 2025, it remains closed, with its 
experimental setups, such as ANKE, TOF, and WASA, decommissioned. However, its impact endures through the scientific
knowledge generated and the technological advancements it seeded, particularly for projects like the High Energy 
Storage Ring (HESR) at FAIR.
