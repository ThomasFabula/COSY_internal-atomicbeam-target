The Cooler Synchrotron COSY was a particle accelerator and storage ring at the Forschungszentrum Jülich in Germany, 
operated by the Institute for Nuclear Physics (IKP) from 1993 until October 2023. With a circumference of 184 meters, 
it accelerated protons and deuterons to momenta between 270 MeV/c and 3.65 GeV/c for experiments in hadron, particle, 
and nuclear physics. COSY was known for its beam cooling techniques—electron cooling up to 645 MeV/c and stochastic 
cooling from 1.5 to 3.3 GeV/c—which ensured high-precision, well-ordered beams for medium-energy physics research.

Key Features:
- Particle Beams: Delivered polarized and unpolarized proton beams (45–2700 MeV) and deuteron beams (90–2100 MeV).
- Cooling Systems: Used electron cooling for low momenta and stochastic cooling for higher momenta to reduce beam 
divergence and enhance precision.
- Experiments: Supported internal (e.g., ANKE, TOF, WASA) and external experimental setups, focusing on hadron physics, 
meson production, and medium modifications in proton-nucleus interactions.
- Research Focus: Recent work included investigating the electric dipole moment (EDM) of protons and deuterons 
(JEDI collaboration), testing components for the Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR), and exploring 
axion-like dark matter.
- Injection: H⁻ or D⁻ ions were produced, accelerated by the JULIC cyclotron to 45 MeV, stripped to protons or
deuterons via a carbon foil, and injected into COSY.

Scientific Contributions:
COSY enabled high-precision experiments probing the strong interaction, quark-gluon structures, and CP violation 
through EDM measurements. It served as a unique "hadron microscope" for studying subatomic structures, offering 
beam energies ideal for resolving proton and neutron components. The accelerator supported both internal experiments
(target and detector within the ring) and external ones (beam extracted via resonant or stochastic methods).

Closure and Legacy:
COSY ceased operations in October 2023. Its experimental facilities, like ANKE, TOF, and WASA, were decommissioned, 
but its contributions to hadron physics and accelerator technology development for projects like FAIR remain significant.
